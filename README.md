# üè≠ Uncovering the Truth of Countries and Their Emissions

## Overview
This project investigates global CO2 emissions across various countries from the year 1900 to 2021 using a comprehensive dataset with Tableau. The visualization consists of three distinct dashboards that are interconnected. Through a series of interactive visualizations, the project highlights trends in CO2 emissions, emission sources, and the contribution of other greenhouse gases such as Methane and Nitrous Oxide. The visualizations offer insights into how industrialization and socio-economic factors drive emissions globally. To have a preview, view the `Main Dashboard.png` to take a look at the main dashboard of the visualization. 

## Dataset Overview
The dataset `filtered_co2_data.csv` consists of approximately 50,600 rows, which include:
  - CO2 Emissions: Total CO2 emissions data.
  - Emission Sources: Sources of CO2 emissions such as coal, oil, and gas.
  - Greenhouse Gases: Other greenhouse gases (e.g., Methane, Nitrous Oxide) influencing temperature changes.
  - Yearly Data: Data is recorded annually from 1900 to 2021.
    
Data has been filtered to exclude years before 1900 due to minimal records, ensuring a cleaner and more relevant analysis.

## Project Structure
1. **Summary Visualization:**
    - A world map depicting the global distribution of CO2 emissions.
    - A historical line chart showing the trend of CO2 emissions from 1900 to 2021.
    - Bar charts displaying average CO2 emissions per capita for the highest and lowest emitting countries.
    - An interactive dashboard allowing users to select specific countries for detailed analysis.

2. **Data Analysis:**
    - **CO2 Emission Trends:** Shows a continuous upward trend in CO2 emissions, especially from the mid-20th century.
    - **Emission Sources:** Analyzes different countries' reliance on various fossil fuels.
    - **Greenhouse Gases Impact:** Reveals the impact of other gases like Methane and Nitrous Oxide on temperature changes.

## Key Findings
1. **Rising Global Emissions:**
    - CO2 emissions have been increasing steadily, with developed regions such as North America, Europe, and parts of Asia being the major contributors.
    - The industrialization and development of these regions are strongly linked to their emission levels.
    
2. **Dependence on Fossil Fuels:**
    - Fossil fuels remain the primary contributors to CO2 emissions.
    - Different countries rely on different types of fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil) based on their economic standing and accessibility.
    
3. **Greenhouse Gas Contributions:**
    - Besides CO2, gases like Methane and Nitrous Oxide play significant roles in climate change, especially in countries with large agricultural sectors.
    
## Storytelling and Interpretation
The visualizations narrate a cohesive story about the global emissions landscape, showing a clear link between economic development and emission levels. Developed countries with extensive industrial activities produce significantly higher emissions, while underdeveloped nations with less infrastructure show lower emission levels.
